                        p Our mission is to provide a safe, friendly, and positive place where fellow Pok?mon Go trainers can coordinate activities and grow as a community! As such, we ask everyone to follow a few simple guidelines.
                            br
                            br
                        ul
                            li Be nice! Rude, trolling, immature, spamming, or generally irritating behavior is not tolerated. We ask that all members be respectful at all times and practice good etiquette, whether online or in-person.
                            li Avoid crass language, topics, usernames, media, or links. We have a wide age range in our community!
                            li We do not allow spoofing. Anyone found to be spoofing or a member of a known spoofing Discord server, can and will be banned from the server.
                            li Please obtain approval from an admin before sharing invites to other servers.
                            li NSFW content is not allowed. Any pornography is forbidden.
                            li Gyms are meant to be taken and swap hands often. Don't get upset if someone takes your gym, take it back!
                            li When possible, be inclusive in your gameplay, remember that denying someone access to your group could result in them being unable to raid.
                            li Understand that if you are late to a raid, the group may do the raid without you. Aim to arrive 5 minutes before the start time.
